# Techno-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project-3
I am uploading my Power BI Project 3 files here in this repository.


Title - Techno Sales Dashboard (2020-2022)

In this project, I worked on sales data across various product categories and brands, uncovering valuable insights that helped track performance and boost business decisions. The goal was to visualize product sales, brand-wise contributions, and sales distribution across different states in India, providing key insights to help optimize business strategies.
The dashboard was built using Power BI, leveraging dynamic visualizations to present sales trends, state-wise performance, and supervisor management across regions.

The Key Highlights are as follows - 

1. "Top-Selling Products" - Monitors lead the sales with 1,843 units, closely followed by Mouse and CPUs.
2. "Brand Performance" - Intel dominates the market with 19% sales, while Samsung and Dell follow at 16% and 14%.
3. "Sales Distribution by State" - The map visualization provides insights into sales concentration in key areas like New Delhi.
4. "Supervisor Insights" - Each sales transaction is linked to a supervisor, with Aadil Khan and Aarvi Gupta leading in sales management.
